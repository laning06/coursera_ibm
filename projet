The aim is to help tourists choose their destinations depending on the experiences that the neighbourhoods have to offer and what they would want to have. 
This also helps people make decisions if they are thinking about migrating to London or Toronto or even if they want to relocate neighbourhoods within the city. 
Our findings will help stakeholders make informed decisions and address any 
concerns they have including the different kinds of cuisines, provision stores and what the city has to offer.
